## 🎓 LEARNING FROM THIS AUDIT

### Key Lesson #1: Information Architecture Matters
Problem: Big claims first, disclaimers buried = misleading  
Solution: Put accurate status first, then detail

### Key Lesson #2: Aspirational vs. Actual
Problem: Mixing planned (roadmap) with actual (implementation)  
Solution: Separate clearly - one page for vision, one for current state

### Key Lesson #3: Verify Claims Before Publishing
Problem: Performance claims made without real-world testing  
Solution: Publish only claims validated in real conditions

### Key Lesson #4: Transparency Builds Trust
Problem: Hiding status changes loses credibility  
Solution: Monthly updates about progress and challenges

### Key Lesson #5: Realistic Timelines Matter
Problem: Missing arbitrary deadlines loses credibility  
Solution: Base timelines on actual velocity, add contingency
